      <p>
This specification describes a mechanism to protect legacy optical barcodes,
such as those found on driver's licenses (PDF417) and travel documents (MRZ),
using Verifiable Credentials [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]. The Verifiable Credential
representations are compact enough such that they fit in under 140 bytes and
can thus be integrated with traditional two-dimensional barcodes that are
printed on physical cards using legacy printing processes.

        <p>
A <dfn>conforming document</dfn> is any concrete expression of the data model
that complies with the normative statements in this specification. Specifically,
all relevant normative statements in Sections
<a href="#data-model"></a> and <a href="#algorithms"></a>
of this document MUST be enforced.
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn class="lint-ignore">conforming processor</dfn> is any algorithm realized
as software and/or hardware that generates or consumes a
<a>conforming document</a>. Conforming processors MUST produce errors when
non-conforming documents are consumed.
        </p>

      	<p>
This document contains examples of JSON and JSON-LD data. Some of these examples
are invalid JSON, as they include features such as inline comments (`//`)
explaining certain portions and ellipses (`...`) indicating the omission of
information that is irrelevant to the example. Such parts need to be
removed if implementers want to treat the examples as valid JSON or JSON-LD.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the data model that is used by this specification
to express [=verifiable credentials=] that secure optically printed information
such as barcodes and machine-readable zones on travel documents.

      <h2>Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
The following section describes algorithms for adding and verifying digital
proofs that protect optical information, such as barcodes and machine-readable
zones, on physical media, such as driver's licenses and travel documents.
